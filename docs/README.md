## Key Updates (September 3, 2025 08:38)

### PRD Evolution
- **Retired**: Original PRD v2.5 (August 31, 2025) - marked as outdated, kept for reference only
- **Active**: New PRD v3.0 - Three-phase execution sequence:
  - **Phase 1**: Automated backfill for all 121 officials using existing AI infrastructure
  - **Phase 2**: Manual verification of ~10-11 known separatists for credibility
  - **Phase 3**: Ongoing automated updates (1-2x per week)

### Strategic Shift
- **From**: Complex manual-first approach with limited coverage
- **To**: Automated-first approach with full coverage + manual verification for critical cases
- **Result**: Faster time to market with comprehensive coverage and high credibility

### Implementation Focus
- Leverage existing three-agent AI system (Agents 1-3)
- Use current SERPHouse ingestion infrastructure
- Build on existing Azure Blob storage structure
- Deliver complete coverage from launch rather than partial rollout

Logs were originally created inside backend/ but have been moved here for clarity.
