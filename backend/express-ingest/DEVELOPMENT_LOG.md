## 2025-08-17 19:59 CT — Critical Issue Identified: Wrong News Search Strategy

**Action**: Discovered that the current news collection system is searching for completely wrong content.

**What Was Wrong**:
- ❌ **Current searches**: Bitcoin, crypto, Trump, random news
- ❌ **Should be searching**: Alberta elected officials + Alberta separation content
- ❌ **Missing**: Representative-specific news filtering

**What We SHOULD Be Capturing**:
- ✅ **Target**: News about Alberta MPs/MLAs regarding Alberta separation
- ✅ **Keywords**: "Alberta separation", "Alberta independence", "Alberta sovereignty"
- ✅ **Scope**: First 10 representatives, then expand to all 121
- ✅ **Focus**: Political content about Alberta's relationship with Canada

**Current Status**:
- News APIs are working ✅
- Representative roster is complete ✅
- Batch processing endpoint is working ✅
- **BUT**: Search strategy is completely off-target ❌

**Next Steps**:
1. Fix news search to target elected officials by name
2. Add Alberta separation keywords to searches
3. Filter results to only relevant political content
4. Test with first 10 representatives

**Status**: ⚠️ **NEEDS IMMEDIATE FIX** - Current implementation is not serving the intended purpose.
